# Wazobia Chops 
I made a one page app for my venture called Wazobia Chops. A place where people can buy fruits and food at an affordabke price. 

# UI elements used in building the items 
Note: My app is not responsive. All buttons,logo,etc. used are static
- Navigational components: This is the component that helps my users move around the app.
  - For the navigational layout I used a Tab bar
  - Things in the navigational components are the shop, cart, explore, favourite and account buttons
- Informational components share information with users.
  - For this I used message boxes with the image of the product, name of the product, price and quantity of the products. 
  -Right bellow the message boxes are buttons to increase the quantity of products a person wants.
